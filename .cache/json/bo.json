{"data":{"friendsJson":{"name":"Bo","description":"<p>Lemon Lip's Mom. She seems to be good friends with Raggedy Anne. I met Bo and Lemon Lips in 2012. No distinguishing marks except for a slight white spot on the front of her dorsal. Very friendly, seems to like it when Lemon Lips swims with me. Maybe gives her a rest! B.B.Tip and Raggedy Anne will swim close to me when all of them are together. Bo seems to want me in the pod.</p>","featuredImage":{"src":{"publicURL":"/static/friend-pic-bo-004ae81d0c3af3c521d06892529a7149.jpg"},"caption":null},"images":null,"videos":[{"src":"//www.youtube.com/embed/uAYaj_RrbHM?rel=0&fs=1&showinfo=1","source":"youtube"}]}},"pathContext":{}}
