{"data":{"friendsJson":{"name":"Lemon Lips","description":"<p>Bo’s calf. He was quite small in 2012. Has yellow lips. Maybe from Mom’s milk? Has lots of energy, whizzes all over. Circles me at speed then shoots off to visit others and comes back as if to tell me to hurry up! Has jumped over me, almost fallen into me. He's a real hot ticket! Seen him nurse and play with B.B.Tip. My most favorite calf.</p>","featuredImage":{"src":{"publicURL":"/static/friend-pic-lemon-e4fc2f22881cdcc72ec2ba5ecad121ff.jpg"},"caption":null},"images":[{"src":{"publicURL":"/static/ra1-deac67078b6075ffdb5f5fae1619bac8.jpg"},"caption":null}],"videos":[{"src":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/149924029","source":"vimeo"},{"src":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/149958729","source":"vimeo"},{"src":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/139253537","source":"vimeo"},{"src":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/fn25FTgPyFo?rel=0&fs=1&showinfo=1","source":"youtube"},{"src":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/cW9yjwN3wCs?rel=0&fs=1&showinfo=1","source":"youtube"}]}},"pathContext":{}}
