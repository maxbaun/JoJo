They have brought me for swims with Mo on my left and JoJo on my right. Mo will swim with me when JoJo isn’t around. He had a friend last year and they let me hang with them. He will go to boats and is okay with people swimming around.</p>","featuredImage":{"src":{"publicURL":"/static/friend-pic-mojo-133da6ac82f3d6ba7a970d7158bc3984.jpg"},"caption":null},"images":null,"videos":[{"src":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/vy-ismXo4yQ?rel=0&fs=1&showinfo=1","source":"youtube"},{"src":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/NRhVetrD4cs?rel=0&fs=1&showinfo=1","source":"youtube"},{"src":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/BadbcaaDWk8?rel=0&fs=1&showinfo=1","source":"youtube"}]}},"pathContext":{}}
