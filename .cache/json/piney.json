{"data":{"friendsJson":{"name":"Piney","description":"<p>I called him Bruiser for a while because he had so many nicks as if he’s been in a fight. They are located before his dorsal. When I met him in 2012 and he was very skinny. I’m not sure of his gender but he is usually by himself near the end of Pine Cay. He has let me swim with him on occasion when he’s by himself. One time I was with him while he was fishing. When there is a meeting of JoJo and the moms and calves he’s very friendly with me.</p>","featuredImage":{"src":{"publicURL":"/static/friend-pic-piney-adffa10486be534dbf35e298e5269375.jpg"},"caption":null},"images":null,"videos":[{"src":"//www.youtube.com/embed/zma6qgbN2PY?rel=0&fs=1&showinfo=1","source":"youtube"}]}},"pathContext":{}}
