{"data":{"friendsJson":{"name":"Snipper","description":"<p>Snipper showed up with JoJo and Whizzer in 2017. Whizzer is now three years old and  has left Bo his Mom.  Calves usually leave their mothers at this age. It is typical of young male dolphins to join other male dolphins when they leave their moms. I think JoJo has orchestrated this relationship because he's so friendly with both dolphins.I have included a picture of what I think is the same dolphin from 2011. He was with JoJo when I took this picture.</p>","featuredImage":{"src":{"publicURL":"/static/friend-pic-snipper-b46fb065e8efbede0a5b28e3c3c811d4.jpg"},"caption":null},"images":[{"src":{"publicURL":"/static/friend-pic-snipper2-eee7dda02f8eabe0605d2b710e381877.jpg"},"caption":null}],"videos":[{"src":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/244487980","source":"vimeo"}]}},"pathContext":{}}
