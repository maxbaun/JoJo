No distinguishing marks other than small blemish the size of a silver dollar on her left side below her dorsal. Very friendly, seems to like it when Lemon Lips swims with me. Maybe gives her a rest! B.B.Tip and Raggedy Anne will swim close to me when all of them are together. Bo seems to want me in the pod. In the late summer of 2018 Bo had a female calf I named Scooter. Like her other calves, she's very friendly with me.</p>",
