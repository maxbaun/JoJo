	"content": "<p>Dean Bernal who was one of the first people to befriend JoJo, was a dive instructor at Club Med. He would take his novice divers for lessons out in front of Club Med. He’d have them all in a circle as he gave them instruction. JoJo on occasion would herd a nurse shark into the circle and watch the pandemonium that would ensue. (Dolphins do like to antagonize nurse sharks.)</p><p>Scotty, who worked at Club Med for many years, told me JoJo would on occasion accompany the dive boats out to the reef. They would drop anchor and put their divers in. Upon looking back at the boat, they would notice it had moved. The culprit was JoJo!! He had moved the anchor. They now had to JoJo proof the anchor by burying it deep into the sand!</p><p>This adds a little more credence to Clifford’s story about JoJo moving his boat.</p>",
