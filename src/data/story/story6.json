	"content": "<p>Many years ago Philip (joint owner of Big Blue) was out fishing with his brother. They had anchored their boat at an appropriate spot and started to fish. They noticed the boat was starting to move away from the spot they anchored it. They figured they needed to throw in again it must have been dragging. This happened a few times until they figured out JoJo was going down and moving the anchor! I asked Philip how he knew this and he said he saw JoJo surface with the anchor on his rostrum!</p><p>Now Cliffordâ€™s story is sounding more believable!</p>"
