	"content" : "Many years ago when I had bought my first boat I was out by Pine Cay and saw a pod of dolphins. At that time I only knew JoJo. One of the dolphins was slapping his tail in the water which I now know is a warning sign. I got in anyway and was happy to have JoJo come greet me. Later he had gone off and the dolphin who was slapping his tail started coming at me once again slapping his tail. I sat still trying not to be a threat. Out of nowhere JoJo came flying under me as close as he possibly could and aimed for the other dolphin. There was lots of whistling and clicking and the other dolphin swam off and left me alone.</p>",
