	"content" : "<p>Clifford also told me that he was out fishing one day. He had the boat anchored a little way from the shore.  He started to feel seriously under the weather. He got worse and worse until he actually passed out on his boat. (Many years later he learned from a doctor that he had suffered a heart attack) When he came to, he saw that JoJo had been picking the anchor up and placing it closer and closer to shore.  Now he  was right at the shore and could climb off the boat to go for help.</p><p>Kayon who works at the Cabana Bar at Ocean Club tells of another rescue. She was with a bunch of friends who were on their way back by boat from a party on her home island of North Caicos when the boat over turned. Kayon didn’t know how to swim and was panicked that she was starting to sink. She felt something push her up so she could breath and get to shore. She’s sure it was JoJo.</p><p>A group of snorkelers were out at Smith Reef when a shark started to come closer and closer making them uncomfortable. JoJo appeared on the scene and killed the shark by ramming him with his rostrum.</p><p>Scotty, who worked at Club Med for many years, told me a story about a small dog. This dog was on a boat and a large wave hit the boat and knocked him overboard. The people on board were sure they’d lost him when he surfaced swimming along with JoJo right beside him.</p>",
